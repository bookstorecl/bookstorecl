👋 Hi, I’m @bookstorecl

👀 I’m interested in sharing and developing open-source solutions for ecommerce, particularly for furniture and office supplies businesses. We are passionate about creating tools that help streamline online shopping experiences and inventory management.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about cloud-based technologies and their integration into ecommerce platforms to enhance our online presence and customer interaction.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve ecommerce plugins, payment gateway integrations, and customer relationship management tools. We are also interested in exploring AI and machine learning to predict customer preferences and improve product recommendations.

📫 How to reach me: You can reach us at our email bookstorecl.hr@gmail.com or through our website www.bookstore.cl. We are also active on social media platforms where we share updates and interact with our community.

😄 Pronouns: We/Us

⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that bookstore.cl started as a small project in a garage? Now we have grown into a leading provider of office furniture and supplies in the region, helping to create comfortable and productive workspaces for thousands!
